# Capstone Project
Group Name: Group Name

## Background:
POV: You are frustrated by the inefficient CCA record updating system in your school. One confusing Excel form, so many ways to fill it in wrong, and so many conflicting versions of the sheet ... this could be done better!<br/>
You decide to form a dev team with some fellow J2s to make a solid system that can serve as a single source of truth for students who wish to manage their records in one place easily. You could even make it export the Excel template the school asks for!<br/>
Before you get too carried away with your plans, you are quickly reminded that the A Level examinations are coming up soon, and you cannot afford to spend too much time on this. As the team lead, and likely the one with the most experience, it is up to you to design the app, and divide up the workload in a way that allows your team members to work independently without tripping over each other. You cannot afford to have Zoom meetings during this critical period!<br/>

## Project requirements:
H2 Computing students in our school intend to keep a record of their CCA participation and achievements. They wish to create an online web application that will store these records in a (SQL/NoSQL) database, and allow them to search the records through an online webpage with multiple forms. <br/>
HTML and CSS were to be used for the frontend framework and Python Flask and sqlite3 / MongoDB database were to be used for the backend framework. <br/>
We were also given a total of around 5 weeks to complete the project and although the project may not be very polished, it gave us a glimpse of how to create a web application from the ground up.
