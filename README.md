# Capstone Project
Group Name: Group Name

## Project info:
H2 Computing students in our school intend to keep a record of their CCA participation and achievements. They wish to create an online web application that will store these records in a (SQL/NoSQL) database, and allow them to search the records through an online webpage with multiple forms.
HTML and CSS were used for the frontend framework and Python Flask and sqlite3 / MongoDB database were used for the backend framework. 
My friends and I worked on this Capstone Project in 2022 and we were given a total of 6 weeks in total to finish up on this project.
